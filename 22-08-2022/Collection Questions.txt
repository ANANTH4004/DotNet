1. Write a program in C# Sharp to store elements in an array and print it. 
(consider array of 10 elements)
Test Data:
Input 10 elements in the array:
element - 0 : 1
element - 1 : 1
element - 2 : 2
.......
Expected Output :
Elements in array are: 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Test Data :
Input the number of elements to be stored in the array :3
Input 3 elements in the array :
element - 0 : 2
element - 1 : 5
element - 2 : 8

12) Find the minimum and maximum element in an array


14) Given a value N, find the number of ways to make change for N cents,
 if we have infinite supply of each of S = { S1, S2, .. , SM } valued coins.
Input:
n = 4 , m = 3
S[] = {1,2,3}
Output: 4
Explanation: Four Possible ways are:
{1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}.
from Sulakshana Deore (Trainer) to All Participants:
Given an array arr[] of size n, find the first repeating element.
 The element should occurs more than once and the index of its first occurrence 
should be the smallest.

Input:
n = 7
arr[] = {1, 5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6}
Output: 2
Explanation: 
5 is appearing twice and 
its first appearence is at index 2 
which is less than 3 whose first 
occuring index is 3.
